 # Run the Dapp
Step 1. Start ganache.

Step 2. Go to KrishiTech Directory and do 'npm install'

Step 3: truffle migrate

Step 4: Important:

In  src directory --> app.js

Line number 43820 --->

change the variable conaddress = "0x363F44A99e7DCcB7e40D41812298dA9a92EEE3fd"; 

The above value of contract address should be changed to the result you get when you do truffle migrate.

When you do truffle migrate you get a contract address !!!
Put that value to conaddress!!!


Step 5: 'npm run dev' to start lite-server

Step 6: Goto localhost:3000

Voila you have the Krishi Bazar running!
