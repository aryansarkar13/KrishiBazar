 # Run the Dapp

Step 2. Go to KrishiTech Directory and do 'npm install'

Step 3: truffle migrate

Step 4: Important:

In  src directory --> app.js

Line number 43820 --->

change the variable conaddress = "0x363F44A99e7DCcB7e40D41812298dA9a92EEE3fd"; 

The above value of contract address should be changed to the result you get when you do truffle migrate.
